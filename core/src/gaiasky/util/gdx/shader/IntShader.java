/**
 * Interface which is used to render one or more {@link IntRenderable}s.</p>
 * <p>
 * A IntShader is responsible for the actual rendering of an {@link IntRenderable}. Typically, when using OpenGL ES 2.0 or higher, it
 * encapsulates a {@link ShaderProgram} and takes care of all OpenGL calls necessary to render the {@link IntRenderable}. When using
 * OpenGL ES 1.x it takes care of the fixed pipeline.</p>
 * <p>
 * To start rendering the {@link #begin(Camera, RenderContext)} method must be called. After which the {@link #end()} method must
 * be called to stop rendering. In between one or more calls to the {@link #render(IntRenderable)} method can be made to render a
 * {@link IntRenderable}. The {@link #render(IntRenderable)} method must not be called before a call to
 * {@link #begin(Camera, RenderContext)} or after a call to {@link #end()}. Each IntShader needs exclusive access to the OpenGL state
 * and {@link RenderContext} between the {@link #begin(Camera, RenderContext)} and {@link #end()} methods, therefore only one
 * shader can be used at a time (they must not be nested).</p>
 * <p>
 * A specific IntShader instance might be (and usually is) dedicated to a specific type of {@link IntRenderable}. For example it might
 * use a {@link ShaderProgram} that is compiled with uniforms (shader input) for specific {@link Attribute} types. Therefore the
 * {@link #canRender(IntRenderable)} method can be used to check if the IntShader instance can be used for a specific {@link IntRenderable}
 * . Rendering a {@link IntRenderable} using a IntShader for which {@link #canRender(IntRenderable)} returns false might result in
 * unpredicted behavior or crash the application.</p>
 * <p>
 * To manage multiple shaders and create a new shader when required, a {@link ShaderProvider} can be used. Therefore, in practice,
 * a specific IntShader implementation is usually accompanied by a specific {@link ShaderProvider} implementation (usually extending
 * {@link BaseShaderProvider}).</p>
 * <p>
 * When a IntShader is constructed, the {@link #init()} method must be called before it can be used. Most commonly, the
 * {@link #init()} method compiles the {@link ShaderProgram}, fetches uniform locations and performs other preparations for usage
 * of the IntShader. When the shader is no longer needed, it must disposed using the {@link Disposable#dispose()} method. This, for
 * example, disposed (unloads for memory) the used {@link ShaderProgram}.</p>
